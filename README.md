# distributed-file-download-network

## Introduction

In many organizations like educational institutions, government entities and private establishments, due to the large number of devices on the network, the  bandwidth/data usage is restricted. It is difficult to download large files from external network and may take a very long time or exceed the data usage policy set by network administrators. The goal of this project is to provide a distributed solution to tackle such problems of throttled bandwidth or data usage.
